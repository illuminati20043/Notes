# What is the Nakba and how does it influence the conflict ? #


The nakba means "catastrophe" Arabic. It took place in 1948, in which more than 750k Palestinians were forcefully displaced from their homes and pushed into refugee camps in East Jersusalem, the West Bank, neighboring countries (e.g. Jordan).


# Events #

According to Benny Morris, the event has 4 phases, while Yoav Gelber believes there are four phases.

## [Benny Morris](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris) ##


According to Benny Morris , four phases : 
- 100 000 Palestinian Arabs from upper class or ruling class fleeing the incoming conflict
- 250 000-300 000 Palestinian Arabs from Haïfa, Tabariya, Beit Shean, Safed, Jaff and Acre losing 90% of the population. Possible start of war, and mostly possible plan going through.
- 50 -70k Arab Palestinians displaced through military from Lydda and Ramallah. Then 200-220k have to flee because of massacre, except for Christian Palestinians.
- 30-40k Arabs are displaced to neighboring countries
### Phase 1 ###

- 29th of November 1947 : UN Partition Plan of Palestine into a Jewish State and an Arab State
- Established Jewish Population : 1 million, with 42% Arabs


- December 1947 : More military operations agaisnt Arab villages, towns and cities (members of Haganah and Irgun) -> 12 dead Arabs and 6 injured
- Al-Abbasiyya : 7 Arab civilians and 34 injured
- Late December attacks by Haganah on Balad-Al-Shaykh : 60 people killed, and Lifta : 2,5k dead Palestinians by 11/01/1948
- Terrorization of 75k Palestinians in Haifa. 20k departures of the city's elites -> Egypt and Lebanon

- February 1948 :  attacks by Jewish militias on villages in the subdistrict of Haifa – Qisarya , Barrat Qisarya , Khirbat al-Burj , and Daliyat al-Rawha -- and Sa'sa' (in the Safad subdistrict) left between 60 and 80 killed and 35 homes destroyed. The survivors were driven out.


### Phase 2 ###

March 1948 : 

**6th of March 1948** :

Since the Brits are still occupying many places in Israel- Palestine, Haganah cannot do anything other than be on the defensive. The Arab Liberation Army and the Holy Jihad are an issue to them.
On the ground, although the Haganah forces were theoretically better equipped and better prepared for war than the already engaged enemy forces, they suffered several significant setbacks. For example, the hundred thousand Jews in Jerusalem were besieged by Abdel Kader al-Husseini's men, making it impossible to resupply them, while almost all of the armored vehicles used for convoys were destroyed. The situation of isolation was the same for the settlements in the Upper Galilee, the Hebron area, and the Negev. Furthermore, the anticipated entry into war of the regular armies of neighboring Arab countries, which were considered more formidable than the Arab forces in Palestine, was not a good sign.



**Plan Dalet (Plan D because Dalet is the fourth letter in Hebrew) : Possible ethnic cleansing?**
[Source : Plan Dalet March 1948](https://palestina-komitee.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Plan-Dalet-March-1948.pdf)
Plan D is based on three previous plans :
- Plan B, September 1945
- May 1946 Plan
- Yehoshua Plan, 1948

The objective of this plan is :
- to gain control of the areas of the Hebrew state and defend its borders. It also aims at gaining control of the areas of Jewish settlement and concentration which are located outside the borders \[of the Hebrew state\] against regular, semi-regular, and small forces operating from bases outside or inside the state.

Expected enemy : 
- Liberation Army affiliated with the Arab League
- Neighboring countries' forces
- Local forces


The Haganah also knows that there is a conjoint plan between the three force
Expected tactics :
