Zionism is a nationalist movement that started in the late 19th century focusing on the establishment of a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine (although Palestine wasn't always the intended destination). While only concretizing itself in the late 19th century, zionism has much deeper roots than it shows. Let us first learn about and understand these roots.  



# Why Palestine ?



## A religious context 

**Genesis 15:18-21 :** *On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates— the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.”*




**Exodus 23:31 :** *“I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out before you.*


For the many more verses, please refer to : [Land Of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Israel#Biblical_borders)




The land of Israel is seen as a promised land to the Jewish people, a gift for the Israelites' obedience. Moreover, despite the multiple historical exiles, Jewish attachment to the land of Israel is shown by a strong sense of belonging and bondedness. 



# The different exiles 

## Persia :

[Persian Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Jews)

Persia has been a jewish residence area since 727 BCE, when they were captured by the Assyrian and Babylonian kings. The first Persian kings were credited for enabling Jewish culture inside their kingdoms, going as far as helping Jews rebuild their own temple, being reconstructed "according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, king of Persia"(Ezra 6:14).

After the fall of Persia, Jerusalem fell into the hands of Alexander the Great. Instead of chaos and discord, Greeks and Jews managed to find a compromise, going so far as to sharing lifestyles and culture. The Ptolemian dynasty would go on to respect Jews, until Antiochus takes power. Not only does he murder thousands and impose antisemitic decrees, he also represses jewish practices like the Shabbat and circumcision.

In 140 BCE, a group of Jews stand up to the tyrant and drive him out of Israel : this event is celebrated as the Hanukkah.
